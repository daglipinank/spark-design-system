description:
  Spark does not provide icons directly. What you see below are proprietary icons in use by Quicken Loans. To supply
  your own icon set, you need to import an svg that contains symbols for the ids referenced below. This symbol file
  should occur in the DOM before the first use element.
restrictions:
 - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple 
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance 
    has a unique data-id property ("icon-1", "icon-2", "icon-1", etc).
